# Tally #
Tally is a exactly as it sounds: it is a tally counter.

## Using Tally ##
You can go to [here][g16-app-tally] to use Tally.

### Features ###
* Items will never be listed more than once. Typing the same item more than once will
instead increase its count.
* Reloading the page will not destroy the current list.
* You can share the current list by sharing the page link. **Updating your list will
not update the list you've already shared.**
* You can export the list to:
  * CSV
  * TSV
  * SQL
  * Google Drive (CSV)

## Contributing to Tally ##
You can either:
1. Wait until Tally is more open for contribution;
2. Send an angry email to [Ghifari160][g16-about-githubProfile] which will probably
be ignored; or,
3. Be impatient and submit a pull request, which will probably be ignored even after
Tally is open for contribution. **So don't be impatient.**

## About Tally ##
[Ghifari160][g16-about-githubProfile] needed to tally a list of items on his day off
from school. Instead of spending five minutes tallying, he decided to write an app
to tally because he was too lazy to stand up and grab a piece of paper. Originally
planned to take about two hours, he ended up spending 24+ hours with this project as
somewhere along the development process, he decided to beautify the project and add
some features as listed [above](#features).

Although this project would've been a good Code Jam project, he came up with the
idea after his school district's Code Jam and stared the work before Google's Code
Jam qualifying round.
